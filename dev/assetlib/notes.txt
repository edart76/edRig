how should individual assets be tracked and indexed?


use uids - each asset has one master uid, independent of its path or name.
all other properties are just indexed under it.

asset objects constructed once by index - lookup and search handled by assetContext facade object


how should uids interact with versioning?
consider a composite uid formed of 2 tokens - <main uid>_<version>

to avoid problem of zfilling, should we just flip representation of version numbers?
