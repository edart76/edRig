what do we need



tree-like asset database
    - full support for tree breakpoints, allowing different levels of iteration within the same tree
    - assetRef integration


basic control rig
    - robust way of creating and linking joints
    - in-scene mirroring tools based on name (leave live instancing for now)


body deformation rig



ephrig
    - graph generation / regeneration
    - marking menu from tree
    - drawing context for snapping joints


what WILL we need
- full tree instancing
- dynamics rig integration



for loops:
- choice between "compile-time" generation, as we have with the tree templating system, and actually running the same op multiple times.
- going with the second one. Although it makes save data assignment more complex, it's way easier to evaluate things like loop iteration variables at the time that they're needed
