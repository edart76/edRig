Testing the principles explored in Raf Anzovin's incredible blog

The higher parts of it can wait for another time - just the posing
capability will be hugely useful




We limit to tree-like or tree-homeomorphic graphs for now -
that's not a limitation on this system, it's just because I can't think
of a way to present a densely-connected control scheme to the user.
I guess it could be useful for cloth or something.

for expanding influence from controls, increase depth
not by individual nodes, but by NODE GROUPS

eg not hand1, forearm, upperArm, clavicle etc -
rather hand, arm, torso, etc
